# SensFieldTestSuite

This project implemented for drawing sensing field bunch of discrete sensors in circular array. Application written in javascript with use of WebGL2 to fastly calculate field value in each pixel.

## Visualisation types
Amplication can draw two visualisation types:
* Magnitude of sensing field,
* Error with reference to middle point of array.

This two types can be used to analize magnetic coil distortions in space.
